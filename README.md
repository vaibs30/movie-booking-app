# Capstone Project
For the final project, I decided to build a movie ticket booking website called 'NOW!'. I tried to sharpen my skills on CSS and HTML and along with that i tried to make use of the grouping and role manager feature of django models. 

I started off the project which drafting out the structure of the database for the website. I wanted to complicate the structure of the database, thereby creating  different screens namely royal, economy and elite for each movie. Each screen has 4 rows and each row has 10 seats. So a user is allowed to book a seat only when a seat in a row is available. When a seat is booked, the website makes use of the fetch api and updates the database. 

For CSS, i made use of carousels and animation.

# File description

index.html file - Displays all movies
create.html - lets thre user create a movie
movie.html - Displays details of the particular movie and allows the user to book a seat in a particular row and a particular screen. 
CSS files for styling the above pages, login, register page.

# Takeaways

With the help of this project I understood the flow of making a structure for the database first and then working on the backend and front-end of the side. In the future, I look forward to add in some features like payment integration. 

Thank you
